This repo is the pr2_robot/scripts directory of the Udacity Advanced 
Pick-n-Place project.  I am knee-deep in rewrites and trouble-shooting so
it represents a potpourri of files that are in various stages of development.
Nevertheless, the most important files can be demarcated which are: 
  
  - publishsegment.py
  - publishsegment2.py

These represent the latest and most advanced iteration of the 
object_recogition.py like files for this project, which implements the 
imaging pipeline including the voxel downsampling, table segmentation, etc.
